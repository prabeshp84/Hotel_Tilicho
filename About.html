                <h2>The Beginning</h2>
                <p>Prabesh Poudel was the one who initially focused on technology and innovation. Instead of jumping straight into the hospitality 
                    industry, he spent several years developing cutting-edge systems and software for businesses. After gaining substantial experience
                    and a successful track record in tech, he returned to the resort venture with a fresh perspective. His expertise in technology played
                    a crucial role in transforming Hotel Tilicho into a luxurious, world-renowned resort by integrating advanced management systems and creating 
                    a top-notch guest experience.
